"""Course toolbox for the DSAA Machine Learning practicals.

This file sits beside the notebook that imports it, and it is cumulative: each
block says which week introduced it, so a week's copy holds what that week and
every week before it needs.

It contains no machine learning. Loading, splitting, imputing, scaling,
encoding, selecting, fitting, scoring and cross-validating all stay written out
in the notebooks, where they are the thing being taught. What is here is shared
constants and small bookkeeping objects, nothing outside the standard library,
and no path of its own: where a block touches the filesystem, the notebook
hands it the folder.
